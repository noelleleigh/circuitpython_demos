# circuitpython_demos
Sketches I've made using CiruitPython (and the Circuit Playground Express)

Most or all of these sketches require the use of the Circuit Playground Express (CPX) Library for CircuitPython. Follow the steps in [this guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-made-easy-on-circuit-playground-express/circuit-playground-express-library) to get set up.

Each project folder has its own README that will tell you what they do. Copy the code in the `.py` file into the `code.py` file on your CPX over USB to run the sketch.
